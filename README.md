Credit Card Transaction Analysis Dashboard

Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze credit card transaction data, providing insights for business decision-making. Key features include:

Transaction Metrics Overview: Summarized key metrics, including total revenue (55M), transaction amount (45M), transaction count (656K), and interest earned (8M), offering a quick financial snapshot.

Card Category Breakdown: Visualized revenue, transaction amounts, and interest earned by card categories (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum), enabling a clear understanding of the contribution from each category.

Revenue Analysis: Showcased revenue by usage type (Swipe, Chip, Online) and expenditure categories (Bills, Entertainment, Fuel, Grocery), helping stakeholders identify areas of high revenue generation.

Utilization Rates: Displayed utilization by card category, with Blue cards having the highest utilization rate at 29.22%, providing insights into card performance.

Quarterly Trends: Analyzed quarterly revenue and transaction volume trends, including a line chart overlay of transaction counts, facilitating seasonal trend analysis.


Outcome: Enhanced understanding of credit card transaction dynamics, enabling targeted strategies for revenue growth and customer segmentation.


World Happiness Report Analysis

Objective:

The objective of this project was to analyze global happiness data from various countries to identify factors influencing happiness levels, such as GDP, freedom, and life expectancy. The goal was to uncover correlations that could inform policies for improving well-being in lower-ranking regions.


Data Preparation: The dataset included happiness scores, GDP per capita, freedom, life expectancy, and other socioeconomic factors for multiple countries over several years.

Dashboard Design:

Top 10 Happiest and Saddest Countries: Visualized as color-coded tree maps, showing the happiness rankings of countries at both ends of the spectrum.

Global Happiness Gauge: A gauge chart provided a quick view of the average global happiness score, giving an overall perspective.

Correlation Scatter Plots: Created scatter plots to illustrate the relationships between happiness scores and GDP per capita, freedom, and life expectancy. Color gradients were used to indicate happiness levels for easy interpretation.

Yearly Filter: Incorporated a filter to explore trends over the years, allowing users to analyze changes in happiness scores and related factors year by year.

Outcome:

Insights into Happiness Correlates: The analysis revealed significant positive correlations between happiness scores and factors like GDP, freedom, and life expectancy. For example, countries with higher GDP per capita and greater freedom generally scored higher in happiness.

Policy Implications: These insights provided a data-backed foundation for policymakers looking to improve national well-being. For instance, countries with low happiness scores could focus on improving economic conditions or enhancing citizensâ€™ freedoms to raise their happiness levels.

Global Comparison: The dashboard enabled stakeholders to compare happiness levels and influencing factors across countries, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic drivers of happiness globally.
