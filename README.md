Airbnb Data Analysis Dashboard

Objective:
To analyze Airbnb listing data to uncover trends in pricing, booking, and customer review patterns across different neighborhoods and room types. The insights from this analysis help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding property investments, pricing strategies, and seasonal demand management.

Data Collection and Preparation: Gathered and cleaned data on Airbnb listings, including attributes such as neighborhood, room type (e.g., entire home, private room, shared room), pricing, review count, and host information.

Dashboard Design:
Key Metrics Overview:
Displayed the average number of reviews per month and the total number of reviews, giving a snapshot of overall demand and customer engagement on the platform.

Showcased total host count and neighborhood count to provide context on the scale of listings analyzed.

Neighborhood and Room Type Analysis:

Total Bookings by Neighborhood Group: A bar chart showing the number of bookings across different neighborhoods (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens), which helps identify the most popular locations.

Average Price by Neighborhood: Visualized the average pricing per neighborhood, highlighting the differences in pricing trends across areas like Tribeca, Riverdale, and Fort Wadsworth.

Average Price by Neighborhood Group and Room Type: Provided detailed insights into pricing based on neighborhood and room type (e.g., entire home/apartment, private room, shared room), helping hosts and investors understand competitive pricing strategies in specific areas.

Seasonal Review and Booking Trends:

Total Reviews by Year: A historical view of review counts per year, useful for identifying changes in customer engagement over time.

Total Reviews by Month: A monthly review trend to observe seasonal peaks, helping hosts to adjust their pricing and availability strategies during high-demand months.

Top Hosts by Total Reviews: Listed the hosts with the most reviews, shedding light on popular hosts who may offer best practices in customer satisfaction.

Filter Capabilities:

Integrated filters for neighborhood groups and room types to enable tailored insights, allowing stakeholders to focus on specific market segments or property types.

Outcome:

Popular Neighborhoods and Pricing Insights: The analysis showed that Manhattan had the highest demand, with room prices significantly influenced by both neighborhood and room type. For instance, entire homes in Manhattan and Brooklyn were found to be priced at a premium compared to private rooms in other areas.

Seasonal Demand Patterns: Identified peaks in reviews during specific months, such as June and July, suggesting that Airbnb hosts could capitalize on higher demand through optimized pricing and availability during these periods.

Actionable Insights for Stakeholders:

For Hosts: Provided insights to maximize occupancy and profitability by adjusting prices based on neighborhood demand and seasonal trends. Hosts could use the data to determine when to list properties at premium prices or offer discounts.

For Investors: Offered clarity on which neighborhoods and room types yield the best returns, guiding investment decisions toward high-demand areas with favorable pricing structures.

Revenue Optimization: The dashboard enabled strategic planning around occupancy rates, targeted marketing efforts for high-demand neighborhoods, and pricing adjustments to boost revenue.

World Happiness Report Analysis

Objective:

The objective of this project was to analyze global happiness data from various countries to identify factors influencing happiness levels, such as GDP, freedom, and life expectancy. The goal was to uncover correlations that could inform policies for improving well-being in lower-ranking regions.


Data Preparation: The dataset included happiness scores, GDP per capita, freedom, life expectancy, and other socioeconomic factors for multiple countries over several years.

Dashboard Design:

Top 10 Happiest and Saddest Countries: Visualized as color-coded tree maps, showing the happiness rankings of countries at both ends of the spectrum.

Global Happiness Gauge: A gauge chart provided a quick view of the average global happiness score, giving an overall perspective.

Correlation Scatter Plots: Created scatter plots to illustrate the relationships between happiness scores and GDP per capita, freedom, and life expectancy. Color gradients were used to indicate happiness levels for easy interpretation.

Yearly Filter: Incorporated a filter to explore trends over the years, allowing users to analyze changes in happiness scores and related factors year by year.

Outcome:

Insights into Happiness Correlates: The analysis revealed significant positive correlations between happiness scores and factors like GDP, freedom, and life expectancy. For example, countries with higher GDP per capita and greater freedom generally scored higher in happiness.

Policy Implications: These insights provided a data-backed foundation for policymakers looking to improve national well-being. For instance, countries with low happiness scores could focus on improving economic conditions or enhancing citizensâ€™ freedoms to raise their happiness levels.

Global Comparison: The dashboard enabled stakeholders to compare happiness levels and influencing factors across countries, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic drivers of happiness globally.
